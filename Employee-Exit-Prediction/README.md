# Assignment-3-Linear-Models-Employee-Exit-Prediction
ML Model for predicting Employee Exit.

Data - Link
Target Column - 'left' (0/1) represents exit or not
Data is heterogeneous in nature, so would need preprocessing before you feed them to ML models
Build a model to predict left column
Don't forget to spilt data in train & test subsets
Data Wrangling & insights graphs are always an important part of data science
